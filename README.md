## Why Pornboss?

**Pornboss is built for people dealing with problems like these**:

- I hoard too many videos, do not have time to watch them all, and have no good way to organize them.
- I want to browse my local JAV library the same way I browse sites like JavBus or JavLibrary, with covers, titles, actresses, and tags.
- Existing local JAV scraping workflows are too complicated and require too many third-party tools.
- I also keep a lot of short local videos and want to tag them in batches and browse them by collection.
- I want instant playback instead of opening a heavy local media player every time.
- I want random discovery so older forgotten videos can surface again.

## Core Features

- **Ready to use**
  Add your media directories after launch and Pornboss starts scanning and organizing immediately. It can auto-detect a local proxy port, so setup stays simple.

- **Automatic code detection**
  Extracts common JAV identifiers from filenames such as `IPX-633`, `SSIS-001`, and `ipx633_ch`.

- **Actress-centric browsing**
  Browse not only by title, but also by actress, and jump directly into one actress's full library.

- **Automatic metadata, cast, tags, and covers**
  Once a code is recognized, Pornboss fetches the JAV title, release date, actress info, tags, and cover art.

- **Separate management for general videos and JAV**
  Homemade clips, compilations, uncensored fragments, and short videos can stay in the regular library, while coded JAV titles go into the JAV library.

- **Automatic local directory scanning**
  Supports multiple directories, discovers new files automatically, updates metadata, and keeps the media library in sync.

- **Screenshot thumbnails and an in-site player with customizable hotkeys**
  Generates preview screenshots for faster browsing, supports direct playback in the browser, and lets you open the original file or containing folder with one click.

- **Batch tagging and powerful tag management**
  Supports batch tagging, tag replacement, and tag-based filtering. Tags for general videos and JAV are managed separately.

- **Tags, search, random, and sorting**
  Filter by tags, code, title, actress, play count, and more, with random browsing and multiple sorting options.

## Quick Start

### 1. Download

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/JavBoss/pornboss/releases) page, download the package for your system, and extract it:

- `windows-x86_64`
- `linux-x86_64`
- `macos-x86_64`
- `macos-arm64`

### 2. Start the App

- Windows: double-click `pornboss.exe`. If SmartScreen blocks it on first launch, click "More info" and continue.
- macOS: right-click `pornboss.command` and choose Open. If macOS shows a security warning, continue anyway.
- Linux: run `pornboss`

After launch, Pornboss will try to open your browser automatically. If it does not, open the local address shown in the terminal manually.

### 3. Add Your Media Directories

Open `Global Settings` -> `Directory Management`, then add the local folders that store your videos. Scanning runs quietly in the background, and videos that are already indexed are available immediately.

### 4. Start Using It

- Manage general adult videos in video mode
- Browse JAV titles by code, work, or actress in JAV mode
- Add custom tags such as `favorite`, `subtitled`, `uncensored`, or `must-watch`
- Use search, random browsing, and sorting to find what you want quickly

## How to Upgrade

After downloading and extracting a new version, copy the current `data` directory into the new version directory. Keep a backup of your data. Do not move the old directory immediately; it is safer to keep the old version around for a while in case the new version has a serious bug.

## Notes

- Pornboss is a local media library manager, not an online streaming site.
- JAV metadata, cover art, and actress information depend on the availability of external websites.
- When importing a large library for the first time, scanning, cover downloads, and metadata completion will take some time.

## Q&A

- Q: I downloaded new videos and want them added to the library, or I want to remove videos I no longer want. What should I do?
- A: Just move videos into or out of a managed directory. Pornboss periodically resyncs the full directory state, so you can safely add, move, or delete files without worrying about losing library data.
</br>

- Q: My video folder is on an external drive. If I launch Pornboss without that drive connected, will the index data be lost?
- A: No. Pornboss checks whether each directory exists at startup, and indexed data is stored persistently. Once the drive is connected again, the data will show up normally.
</br>

- Q: How do I move a managed directory?
- A: Move it directly, then update the directory path in directory management.
